# Crop

Crop is a simple command-line application for cropping images. Sometimes, I don’t want to open GIMP and crop images manually. When working with a large number of images, it can be a headache. After all, I just need these cropped images as placeholders for website designs. That’s why I created this program.

## Install

You can install Crop using `go install` command.

```
go install github.com/enindu/crop
```

## Usage

Here is an example of how to use Crop.

```
crop [path] [type <jpg|png>] [width] [height]
```
